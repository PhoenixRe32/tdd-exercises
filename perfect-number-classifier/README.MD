## Perfect Number Classifier

A "Perfect Number" is a number in which the sum of its factors (excluding itself) are equal to itself.

Write a function that can classify if the given integer is a perfect number.

### Example

`factors(28) --> 1, 2, 4, 7, 14`

`1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28` therefore 28 **IS** perfect number!

### First few perfect numbers
