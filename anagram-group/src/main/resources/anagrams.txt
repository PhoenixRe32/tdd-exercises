"Be Like Water" 
We break tile
Ozan Sarikaya (a well-known quotation attributed to martial-arts expert Bruce Lee)
Just because some of us can read and write and do a little math, that doesn't mean we deserve to conquer the universe. 
A masquerade can cover a sense of what is real to deceive us; to be unjaded and not lost, we must, then, determine truth.
Cory Calhoun (Quotation by Kurt Vonnegut)
There is only one thing worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about 
Wilde died broken, beaten 'n' total nut. Hate being sunk in that rotten gaol. Shh, gay is taboo.
Larry Brash (Quotation by Oscar Wilde)
To be or not to be: that is the question, whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
In one of the Bard's best-thought-of tragedies, our insistent hero, Hamlet, queries on two fronts about how life turns rotten.
