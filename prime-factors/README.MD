## Prime Factor

Write a class named “PrimeFactors” that has one static method: generate.

The generate method takes an integer argument and returns a List. That list contains the prime factors in numerical sequence.

For example:

    100 should return 2, 2, 5, 5
    2 should return 2
    Smaller than 2 should return an empty list
